1.  To comment C++ code:

    Inserting "//" will identify everything after this symbol as a comment on a single line.  To add a block comment that can span
    multiple lines, insert the desired comment between the asterisks of the "/* */" symbol.
    
2.  To comment Python code:

    The "#" symbol is used to comment out a single line.  To identify a block of code as a comment, insert the code between three
    double quotation marks, literally: """comment""".
    
3.  What kind of file has extension ".md"?

    Markdown files have extension ".md".  Markdown languages control the styling of webpages and other computer interfaces using
    plain text.  The primary example of a markdown language is HTML.
    
4.  How to strip whitespace from the end of a string in C++:
    
    One way to strip the whitespace from the end of a string in C++ is to use the algorithm provided by the pixel compressor file:
    
    #include <string>
    string whitespace(" \t\f\v\n\r");  // Define whitespace characters
    sampleString.substr(0, sampleString.find_last_not_of(whitespace));  // This returns a substring beginning at the zeroth element of 
    sampleString and ending at the last character in sampleString that is not the parameter, which in this case is whitespace,
    of the the find_last_not_of function.  Note that this function will not strip whitespace inside the string, but only whitespace
    that trails the last character.

5.  How to create an object of type T and its pointer:

    Generically, without formatting and in connection to a function or class you need the following:

    template <class T>
    T object;
    T * objectPtr = &object;
